# Magento2-Geo Assignment Submission-Yang

#### Version 0.0.1

This respository contains a few extensions that I need for a Magento2 test.

Most extension I have done are in [app](https://github.com/debuggeryang/magento-test/tree/development/app) directory.

This Magento has been deployed on an [AWS EC2 instance](http://54.79.153.136/). Here is the [admin page](http://54.79.153.136/admin_bnboax/). If you want to install this Magento, please clone this repo and and run `compser install` and then `bin/magento setup:install`
