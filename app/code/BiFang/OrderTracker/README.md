## Magento2 Order Tracker Extension
#### Version 0.0.1
--------------------------------

1. What issues this module solves:

    - Once customer purchases any paid product, they are redirected to a Geo-map (order tracking) page showing the geo tracking of the delivery in real-time;
    - Provide delivery ETA and distance and traffic conditions;
    - The map data is from Mapbox SDK/API;

2. To do

    - Customers can also find the map when they are viewing orders on the account dashboard page;
    - The order status (awaiting payment/invoiced/packing/dispatched) should be considered when tracking;
    - Get weather condition data and adjust ETA based on the weather;
